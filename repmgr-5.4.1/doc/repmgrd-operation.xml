  <para>
    In normal operation, &repmgrd; monitors the state of the
    PostgreSQL node it is running on, and will take appropriate action if problems
    are detected, e.g. (if so configured) promote the node to primary, if the existing
    primary has been determined as failed.
  </para>

  <para>
    However, &repmgrd; is unable to distinguish between
    planned outages (such as performing a <link linkend="performing-switchover">switchover</link>
    or installing PostgreSQL maintenance released), and an actual server outage. In versions prior to
    &repmgr; 4.2 it was necessary to stop &repmgrd; on all nodes (or at least
    on all nodes where &repmgrd; is
    <link linkend="repmgrd-automatic-failover">configured for automatic failover</link>)
    to prevent &repmgrd; from making unintentional changes to the
    replication cluster.
  </para>

  <para>
    From <link linkend="release-4.2">&repmgr; 4.2</link>, &repmgrd;
    can now be &quot;paused&quot;, i.e. instructed not to take any action such as performing a failover.
    This can be done from any node in the cluster, removing the need to stop/restart
    each &repmgrd; individually.
  </para>

  <note>
    <para>
      For major PostgreSQL upgrades, e.g. from PostgreSQL 11 to PostgreSQL 12,
      &repmgrd; should be shut down completely and only started up
      once the &repmgr; packages for the new PostgreSQL major version have been installed.

      If the primary becomes available again (e.g. following a software upgrade), &repmgrd;
      will automatically reconnect, e.g.:

   When &repmgrd; is running with the option <literal>monitoring_history=true</literal>,
  it will constantly write standby node status information to the

  overview of replication status on all nodes

 <para>
   The view <literal>replication_status</literal> shows the most recent state

 <para>
  The interval in which monitoring history is written is controlled by the
  configuration parameter <varname>monitor_interval_secs</varname>;
  default is 2.
 </para>
 <para>
  As this can generate a large amount of monitoring data in the table
  <literal>repmgr.monitoring_history</literal>. it's advisable to regularly
  purge historical data using the <xref linkend="repmgr-cluster-cleanup"/>
  command; use the <literal>-k/--keep-history</literal> option to
  specify how many day's worth of data should be retained.
 </para>
 <para>
  It's possible to use &repmgrd; to run in monitoring
  mode only (without automatic failover capability) for some or all
  nodes by setting <literal>failover=manual</literal> in the node's
  <filename>repmgr.conf</filename> file. In the event of the node's upstream failing,
  no failover action will be taken and the node will require manual intervention to
  be reattached to replication. If this occurs, an
  <link linkend="event-notifications">event notification</link>
  <varname>standby_disconnect_manual</varname> will be created.
 </para>
 <para>
  Note that when a standby node is not streaming directly from its upstream
  node, e.g. recovering WAL from an archive, <varname>apply_lag</varname> will always appear as
  <literal>0 bytes</literal>.
 </para>
 <tip>
  <para>
   If monitoring history is enabled, the contents of the <literal>repmgr.monitoring_history</literal>
   table will be replicated to attached standbys. This means there will be a small but
   constant stream of replication activity which may not be desirable. To prevent
   this, convert the table to an <literal>UNLOGGED</literal> one with:
   <programlisting>
     ALTER TABLE repmgr.monitoring_history SET UNLOGGED;</programlisting>
  </para>
  <para>
   This will however mean that monitoring history will not be available on
   another node following a failover, and the view <literal>repmgr.replication_status</literal>
   will not work on standbys.
  </para>
